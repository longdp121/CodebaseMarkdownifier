# Project to Markdown Script

This script is a simple and effective tool that can turn any project into a single `.md` (Markdown) file. It's perfect for generating a comprehensive overview of your project structure and content.

## Features

- Lists all files in the project (excluding specified file types)
- Appends the content of each file to the Markdown file
- Excludes binary and other specified file types
- Each file content is separated by its file name as a header

## How to Run

1. Download the script file (`.sh`) and place it in the root directory of your project.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.

3. Run the following command to give the script execute permissions:

    ```bash
    chmod +x script.sh
    ```

4. Run the script with the following command:

    ```bash
    ./script.sh
    ```

5. The script will generate a `README.md` file in the same directory, containing a list of all files and their content.

Please note: This script excludes certain file types (such as images and binary files) from the generated Markdown file. If you want to include these file types, you will need to modify the script.
